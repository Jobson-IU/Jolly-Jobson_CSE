Problem Statement

 Patients in countries like the UK and Germany often face long waiting times, ranging from weeks to months, for non-emergency medical appointments. Existing platforms such as Doctolib display availability for individual clinics only, making it difficult for patients to compare slots across hospitals or receive alerts when earlier appointments open due to cancellations.

 Proposed Solution 
 
The proposed web platform connects multiple hospitals and clinics within a region, enabling patients to:  Multi-Hospital Search: View and compare available slots across hospitals and clinics by specialty and location.  Cancellation Waitlist System: Join a digital waitlist and receive automatic email alerts when earlier slots open.  Real-Time Availability: Display live updates of appointments, showing the earliest available options.  Urgency Filter: Indicate routine or urgent needs to find suitable slots faster.  Automated Reminders: Send email confirmations and reminders before appointments. 

Expected Outcome 

The system aims to reduce average waiting times by 40%, improve slot utilization by 60%, and raise patient satisfaction by 35%. It will demonstrate a scalable, real-time healthcare booking platform supporting 100+ users, loading searches within three seconds, and maintaining 99% uptime.
